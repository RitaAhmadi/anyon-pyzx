# anyon-pyzx
PyZX is a package written based on the ZX calculus. It represents circuits in the ZX-calculus and simplifies them based on a list of rewrite rules. For further information, see  <cite>[1]</cite>. This notebook shows the simplifying rules and braid generators of two topological quantum computing models, i.e. Fibonacci and Ising. It is an accompanying code with
<cite> [2]</cite>. 

In this paper, we rectify confusion around a category describing an anyonic theory and a category describing topological quantum computation. We show that the latter is a subcategory of \hilb. We represent elements of the Fibonacci and Ising models, namely the encoding of qubits and the associated braid group representations, with the ZX-calculus and show that in both cases, the Yang-Baxter equation is directly connected to an instance of the P-rule of the ZX-calculus. In the Ising case, this reduces to a familiar rule relating two distinct Euler decompositions of the Hadamard gate as $\pi/2$ phase rotations, whereas in the Fibonacci case we give a previously unconsidered exact solution of the P-rule involving the Golden ratio. We demonstrate the utility of these representations by giving graphical derivations of the single qubit braid equations for Fibonacci anyons and the single- and two-qubit braid equations for Ising anyons.

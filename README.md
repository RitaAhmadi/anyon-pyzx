PyZX is a package written based on ZX-calculus. It represents circuits in the ZX-calculus and simplifies them based on a list of rewrite rules. For further information, see  <cite>[1]</cite>. This notebook shows the simplifying rules and braid generators of of two topological quantum computing models, i.e. Fibonacci and Ising. It is an accomponying code of
